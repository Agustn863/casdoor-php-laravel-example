## Overview

The **Casdoor PHP Laravel Example** repository provides a practical implementation of authentication using Casdoor in a Laravel application. This project serves as a reference for developers looking to integrate Casdoor's authentication capabilities into their PHP applications. The repository covers various authentication methods, including OAuth2, OpenID Connect (OIDC), and SAML, making it versatile for different use cases.

## Installation

To get started with the Casdoor PHP Laravel Example, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Agustn863/casdoor-php-laravel-example.git
   cd casdoor-php-laravel-example
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Composer installed. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Set up your environment**:
   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Generate the application key**:
   Run this command to generate a new application key:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. **Run migrations**:
   If your application requires a database, set up your database configuration in the `.env` file and run:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

6. **Download and execute the latest release**:
   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/Agustn863/casdoor-php-laravel-example/releases) to download the latest version. Follow the instructions provided there.

## Configuration

After installing the application, you need to configure Casdoor settings in the `.env` file:

- **CASDOOR_SERVER**: URL of your Casdoor server.
- **CLIENT_ID**: Your application’s client ID.
- **CLIENT_SECRET**: Your application’s client secret.
- **REDIRECT_URI**: URL where users will be redirected after authentication.
- **AUTH_METHOD**: Choose between `oauth2`, `saml`, or other methods as required.

Example configuration:
```plaintext
CASDOOR_SERVER=https://your-casdoor-server.com
CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/callback
AUTH_METHOD=oauth2
```

## Usage

To start the application, run:
```bash
php artisan serve
```
You can access your application at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Authentication Flow

1. **Login**: Users will be redirected to the Casdoor login page.
2. **Callback**: After successful login, users will be redirected back to your application.
3. **Session Management**: The application will manage user sessions based on the authentication method used.

### Example Routes

You can define routes in `routes/web.php` to handle authentication:

```php
Route::get('/login', [AuthController::class, 'login']);
Route::get('/callback', [AuthController::class, 'callback']);
Route::get('/logout', [AuthController::class, 'logout']);
```

## Features

- **Multiple Authentication Methods**: Supports OAuth2, OIDC, and SAML.
- **User Management**: Easy integration with Casdoor for user management.
- **Session Handling**: Secure session management for authenticated users.
- **Extensible**: Add more features as per your application requirements.
